Used oftenly but not created by own
Its great for construction of objects with lot of parameters and we want to make it immutable once constructing it
----------------------------------------------------------------
Features:
1. Handles complex constructors
2. Large parameters
3. Immutability
eg StringBuilder
----------------------------------------------------------------
The creation of multiple constructors with each parameter variation is called telescoping constructor.

Builder patten helps us solve it by handling with object than with parameters. 
Builder is typically written with static inner class
Negates the need for exposed setters
----------------------------------------------------------------

Both bean class and telescope class are not suitable to create immutable and customizable instance

(not really)Pitfalls:
1. Immutable class is generated everytime
2. static inner class is used. It can cause issue when same builder is used again (can set stale data from previous use)-- see code.
    2.1 INC would solve this problem, but the lines of code would increase + pattern would break 
    2.2 You need to add no-arg constructor for construction of lunchOrder. 
    2.3 Then again you would use this object to create builder to make actual lunchOrder which is against pattern. 
    2.4 Not a hardbound code problem, but not clean coding
3. Builder class objects are Designed first and not refactored like Prototype pattern
4. Adds a little complexity in implementing the class than what could have been done with just a constructor but without nice features of builder patterns.
    4.1 Additionally, we generally don't return references at the end of call -> so complexity of Builder increases
----------------------------------------------------------------

Builder vs Prototype
--------------------
Builder
1. handles complex constructor
2. no interface, but can be implemented with it
3. can be implemented with separate class even though its typically implemented in the class it is building --!!>wording<!!--
    3.1 Since it is implemented in separate class, it can be integrated with Legacy code without much change

Prototype
1. implemented around clone method
2. avoids the need of calling complex constructor
3. clone method is focused around member variables and constructor, hence it is implemented inside the class it is trying to clone --!!>wording<!!--
4. difficult to implement in legacy code

Both these are focused on complex constructors within the class. Both having different approach. Builder calls the constructor while Prototype avoids it
------------------------------------------------

Summary
creative way to deal with complexity
easy to implement
very few drawbacks
can refactor with separate class -> no need to make static class an inner class
