Singleton vs Factory
--------------------
Singleton
-> returns same instance everytime
-> one constructor method with no args -> private constructor, so no access to it
-> no interface for returning custom objects
-> (gfg) Singletons can make unit testing difficult since they introduce a global state. This can complicate testing components that depend on a Singleton, as its state can influence the test results.
-> (gfg) The Singleton pattern creates a global dependency, which can complicate replacing the Singleton with a different implementation or using dependency injection.
-> not every class in application needs to be a singleton. Factory can also have adv.

Factory
-> returns various instances of various types
-> has multi constructors
-> interface driven -> we want to abstract out the backend and some things we are returning, hence we expose an interface with a Factory
-> easy to unit test
-> adaptable to env. while singleton is not

Summary
-------
We use singleton when we want to guarantee one instance
its easy to implement
easy to thread safe 
Helps us solve the problem of single instance, but is abused in apps
Not everything needs to be singleton, and be aware of its difference with factory pattern
Helpful in memory utilization

Things to take care while implementing this DP
* static instance
* volatile instance
* reflectionAPI problem
* static synchronization

Note:
Cleaner solution with inner class (class loads once in lifetime) - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/singleton-design-pattern/#:~:text=Instantiation%20through%20inner%20class
