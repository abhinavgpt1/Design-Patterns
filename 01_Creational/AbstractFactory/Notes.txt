Implemented as factory of factory.
Not necessarily requires factory pattern, but it is called factory of related objects
common interface concept taken to another level
invloves subclass instantiation
eg. DocumentBuilderFactory - java XML apis
    Frameworks

Design:
-------
Group of factories
Has Common interface for factory instantiation
Parameterized create method. Factory is returned based on parameter
Made with Composition, which was not there in factory pattern -> (key distinction btw factory and abstractFactory)
The goal to not let the client know the implementation and not even to the abstractFactory. 
    Right factory and concrete classes should be deferred (based on params) and client should be provided with the functionality via interface (interface reference).

Structure: abstractFactory -> factory -> product
----------

Another exmaple of abstract factory 
-> [done in pluralsight] client provides me a credit card score. An based on that score I provide an Amex/Visa card. Now you may choose any among Gold or Platinum.
-> 1. if creditScore > 650 you provide client with AmexFactory else VisaFactory named as CreditCardFactory
-> 2. Now using getCreditCard function client may opt for GOLD/PLATINUM

Another exmaple of abstract factory 
-> [told in pluralsight] Say we have multiple DB connections - SQLServer, MySQL, Oracle and I want to execute queries (as string) using abstract function execute();

Pitfall
-------
Most complex design pattern to implement
Runtime switch - since, there's params involved one may be concerning that client knows about implementation in a way that what set of params will fetch me what results (.class)
    It isn't an issue to worry as implementation logic is not exposed
Pattern within pattern
Solves a particular problem - grouping of factories
Starts as factory and then refactored to AbstractFactory -> i.e. you implement all factories, once that's done collab them under abstractFactory

Factory vs AbstractFactory
--------------------------
[F & AF] multiple/various instances with multiple constructors
[F & AF] interface driven and adaptable to env.
[AF] Implemented with a factory - 99% times although not necessary
[AF] Hides underlying concrete factories
[AF] Adds another layer of abstraction to env.
[AF] Build through composition
[AF] Heavly abstracts - interfaces, abstract classes(contracts) subclass, composition 
[AF] Framework pattern, whereas other design patterns are solving a particular problem
