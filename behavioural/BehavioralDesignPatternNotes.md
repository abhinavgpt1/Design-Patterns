11 Design Patterns under Behavioral Design Pattern:

1. Chain of Responsibility
    Def: Pass requests along a chain of handlers until one handles it
2. Command
    Def: Encapsulate requests as objects to enable undo/redo and queuing
3. Interpreter
    Def: Define a grammar and interpret sentences in that language
4. Iterator
    Def: Traverse a collection without exposing its internal structure
5. Mediator
    Def: Centralize complex communications between objects through a mediator
6. Memento
    Def: Capture and restore an object's state without violating encapsulation
7. Observer
    Def: Notify multiple objects when one object's state changes
8. State
    Def: Change an object's behavior when its internal state changes
9. Strategy
    Def: Encapsulate interchangeable algorithms and select one at runtime
10. Template Method
    Def: Define an algorithm skeleton, letting subclasses override specific steps
11. Visitor
    Def: Add new operations to objects without modifying their classes
